# FRSeatGeekiOSExercise


A demonstration of my ability to design and develop a high quality iOS application. This app uses the public SeatGeek API to display events. This app uses XCUITest to fully test all requirements.


## Requirements: 



- To search an event UISearchBar should be used and it should be placed on the top of the UITableView.



- Tapping on Event UITableViewCell should display the corresponding event in a detail

    screen. Tapping on the back button should take user back to the events tableview.



- User should be able to favorite events from the detail screen by hitting the favorite

    button. Favorited events should be displayed on the events tableview as shown below.



- Even when searching or closing the application, a favorited event should remain favorited. 



- A user should be able to unfavorite the event as well.

## Installation



You should have Xcode installed.



Clone the repository and open the FRSeatGeekiOSExercise.xcworkspace file. The dependencies should be already included in the project so you should be able to run without issues.



If you do have an issue running, install the required dependencies using cocoapods.

```bash

cd ~/$project_directory

pod install

```
